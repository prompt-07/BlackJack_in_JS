What are the Blackjack Rules?

1) Before the game begins, every player has to place a bet.
2) The dealer deals two cards each to all players and themselves. All the cards are dealt with face up except the dealerâ€™s second card.
3) Once all the players get two cards each, they can make any one of the three choices. The first choice is to hit. If one chooses to hit, they are asking for another card to be dealt with them.
4) If one chooses to stand, that means they are staying their hand and do not need more cards.
5) If one gets both the cards of the same number, they can choose to split.
6) An ace can be 1 or 10, and face cards have a value of 10.
7) The dealer can only stand when they have reached 17 or more.
